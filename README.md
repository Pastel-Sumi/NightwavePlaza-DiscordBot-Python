* ~~Being able to stream the Nightwave Plaza Radio~~
* ~~Fix enconding issues with metadata regarding Artist/songs using funny symbols (A E S T H E T I C)~~ *Probably fixed*
* ~~Use the metadata of the radio stream to get current song and artist playing.~~
* QoL stuff ()
  * Trying to fix Some micro disconnection issues
  * ~~In process of creating a /reconnect command~~
  * Trying to fix some ffmpeg related issues.
* Throw everything in a docker/kubernetes (Cause why not, a reason to learn how to use these technologies).
* Make a tutorial section in how to setup the bot.
