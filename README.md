# NightwavePlaza-DiscordBot-Python
A small project to learn how discord bots work. A bot that plays streams the nightwave plaza radio. It also plays music from youtube links.

## To do:
* ~~Play youtube links in voicechat~~
* ~~Make a queue system~~
* ~~Make the bot disconnect after 5 minutes without interactions~~
* ~~Being able to stream the Nightwave Plaza Radio~~
* Use the metadata of the radio stream to get current song and artist playing.
* QoL stuff ()
* Throw everything in a docker/kubernetes (Cause why not, a reason to learn how to use these technologies).
* Make a tutorial section in how to setup the bot.
